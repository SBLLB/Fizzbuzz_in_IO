FizzBuzz
========
The Counting Game
------------------

This method was written using Io following a mornings introduction to the prototype-based programming language. 

### How it works


The program has been written to count from 1 to 100, replacing 
* multiples of 3 with "Fizz"
* multiples of 5 with "Buzz"
* multiples of 15 with "FizzBuzz"

The testing has been written in Io also.
